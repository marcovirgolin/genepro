# Meeting 1 - Monday 30/5

## Ideas

* Elitism
* Gray Box Perspective - Use physics knowledge to exclude / include some nodes from the primitive set
* Tanh activation - More sensitive than clipping becuse it imposes a difference between +1 and +1.2 for example
* Ask about format of reward
* Regularization
* How does the coordinate system adapt to angular shifts
